# A word from grace
Second good morning,

I’ve done some very bad map drawings of layouts. The existing one willl actually be the archive page and it’s as you’ve already done but with name of hat appearing above image and credit below. And the in the top left that menu icon that everyone knows.

Then I’m not really sure how the further info and pics should be layedout but maybe if you then click on the image it takes you to a new page ? And the blurred images that were in a grid become a blurred scroll at the top? Or maybe instead when you click it becomes a shape with many sides you have to manipulate around and each side has a different pic ? The second option is more fun and would work on a phone too I assume.

Then I think the title entrance page with isaac’s full res logo with animation squiggly threads unfurling and waving around and on the end of them are the different pages you can click to navigate to. Would Isaac need to do that? They don’t need to look like threads just meandering lines Landscape for desktop and portrait for phone:


Then perhaps for the shop page it can be a horizontal blurred bar across the screen as there will be much fewer items. I’m not wanting a proper pay portal thing put in but probably just a hyperlink to a contact box that’ll send to my email. (I have a separate proton mail) Would that be possible?

I wish you another good morning and don’t need to reply to these obviously until you’ve got to your quarantine even !

Big breakfast hug,
Gracely grace
